# Best Http

> A library for connecting Unity3D to the SignalR server

BestHttp is a purchased library. So I have to ignore this library from my repo. To communicate with the SignalR server, you need to download this library from [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/best-http-10872).

After downloading BestHttp, follow these steps:

- Open Game Unity project
- Go to `Game\Assets\Plugins` directory (Here directory)
- In the project window, right click and select `Import Package > Custome Package...`
- Select the BestHttp Unity package
- In the opened window, click on `Import` button and wait for extract package
- Enjoy!
